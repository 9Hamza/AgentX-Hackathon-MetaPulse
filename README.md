This is a 3D game that will analyze player's voice through AI speech & emotion recognition and will reflect that change onto the game.

This project is part of the AgentX Hackathon. (still under development...)

### Technologies Used
- Unity (records voice through mic and sends it to AI, then reflects emotion in gameplay)
- Google Gemini (speech and emotion recognition) -> fast solution 
- NeMo from Nvidia (speech and emotion recognition) -> trained model
